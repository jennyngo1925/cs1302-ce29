## Questions
   i. There are not any drastic changes, although it does make it harder to
    distinguish the lines apart from each other. Before changing X_FINAL and Y_FINAL,
    it was easier to see the differences in slope and where the line crosses the y-axis.
  ii. Similar to the change from before, there were no drastic changes between any of the
    linear functions, they just looked flatter due to the extra range that they could be
    plotted over, and it was harder to pick apart each line.
 iii. As Y_FINAL increases, the quadratic functions appear to space out more. The reason is because quadratic functions grow at an exponential rate, meaning the rate at which the x-values grow (in this case) increases more and more as the y-value increases. As Y_FINAL increases, we are seeing more of the graph veritcally. As a result, the quadratic graphs seem more spaced out because of their exponential growth.
  iv. As Y_FINAL increases, the linear functions appear to get closer together. The reason is because as Y_FINAL increases, the rate of change for the linear graphs remain the same, so when we "zoom out" of the graphs, the space between each linear graph is the same graphically, but smaller visually.
   v. In the presence of cubics, the quadratics are even more spaced out that they almost appear linear. This is because cubic functions grow at an even faster rate than quadratics, so when we change
    Y-FINAL so drastically to see the effect on cubic functions, we are just maginifying a smaller part of the quadratic function, making it seemed more spaced out and less curved.
  vi. In the presence of cubics, the linear functions become even harder to distinguish, all blurring together as if they were one line. Again, just because we changed Y_FINAL, the rate of change
    for the linear functions remain the same, so graphically nothing has changed, but visually the spaces between the lines have pretty much disappeared. The cubic function grows significantly faster
    than the linear function.
 vii. In the presence of exponentials, the cubics do not seem as spaced out as they had before. This
    is because the cubic functions grew at the fixed cubic rate (the polynomial of 3) whereas
    the exponential function changes much more rapidly.
viii. In the presence of exponentials, the quadratics all start to look the same as if they are all
    mergining into one function. This is once again due to the much slower growth rate of quadratics
    in comparison to exponential functions.
  ix. In the presence of exponentials, the linears basically look like one line as they Y_FINAL increased so much
    that the space between them looks as if it is no longer there. The rate of growth for a linear function
    is fixed whereas the exponential functions' growth rate  is changing, increasing as it approaches Y_FINAL.
   x. We think the instructors wanted us to see how the different functions behaved and which algorithms
    are more efficient to use when trying to solve a problem.

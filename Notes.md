## Questions
   i. There are not any drastic changes, although it does make it harder to
    distinguish the lines apart from each other. Before changing X_FINAL and Y_FINAL,
    it was easier to see the differences in slope and where the line crosses the y-axis.
  ii. Similar to the change from before, there were no drastic changes between any of the
    linear functions, they just looked flatter due to the extra range that they could be
    plotted over, and it was harder to pick apart each line.
